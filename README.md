# Destiny Compendium Bot

## Introduction
The Discord Compendium Bot is a bot for Discord that allows users to query the expansive Destiny Compendium spreadsheet without having to open a web browser and search for it there.

## How can I add this bot to my Discord server?

## How can I use this bot in a Discord server?
The bot is extremely simple to use. The main command featured by the bot is the **/query** command. This command takes in 2 required arguments:

- **Category**: The category of the search refers to the specific sheet on the Destiny Compendium (eg. "Solar" or "Exotic Armor"). These are predefined and can be selected as a dropdown list.
- **Query**: The query part is effectively a simple search through the Compendium. The bot will search through the sheet, using your requested string as the base (eg. a query for "stag" will match the first entry that contains "stag" (case insensitive), that is in the requested category).

## How can I host my own version of this bot?
You can host your own version of the bot, but it takes some work. **NEEDS WRITING**.
